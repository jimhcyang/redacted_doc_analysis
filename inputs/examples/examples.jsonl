This activity would place Soviet personnel in the region opposite the Pakistani states of Chitral and Dir, which are subject to only limited and indirect control by Karachi, and near the sensitive Mohmand tribal area which lies astride the Afghan-Pakistani border.

The restive local tribes have opposed this construction because such road development facilitates the extension of central government control in their territory.
